# Multi-Agent Think Tank

A sophisticated multi-agent system that leverages collaborative AI agents for complex problem-solving and analysis.

## Core Concept

The system consists of 7 specialized agents working together as a think tank:

1. **The Strategist**: Long-term planning and direction
2. **The Analyst**: Data-driven pattern recognition
3. **The Creative Thinker**: Novel idea generation
4. **The Synthesizer**: Concept connection and integration
5. **The Implementer**: Practical execution planning
6. **The Researcher**: Deep knowledge exploration
7. **The Challenger**: Critical evaluation

## Key Components

### Agent Personas and Expertise
- Distinct personalities and specializations
- Access to specialized knowledge bases
- Understanding of human behavior and psychology
- Advanced reasoning capabilities

### Workflow Nodes
- Problem Definition
